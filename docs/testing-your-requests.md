title: Testing your Requests
---

We recommend testing your requests in our [API explorer](/explorer).
For starters&mdash;and for inspiration&mdash;you can view examples
under the **Query Examples** section of our dev portal.

To test and adapt an example:

1) Copy one of the example queries and its query variables into the API explorer  
(like [Tournaments by Location](examples/queries/tournaments-by-location)), then execute the query:

2) Adjust the query and its variables in the API Explorer and then execute it again.
Use the documentation explorer on the right side of the API Explorer to discover other fields you can include!
