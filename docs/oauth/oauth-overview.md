## Notice

OAuth is currently in a closed alpha state for testing purposes. You must be in the closed beta for this to work.

OAuth Public release is coming soon and will have an announcement when it is available. 

However, if you see something missing from these docs or have suggestions regarding scopes, please file an issue to
contribute to the discussion!

## What is OAuth?

The OAuth 2.0 flow enables developers to create applications that utilize personal data from start.gg.
This allows for far more powerful integrations than using a public access token- users can access
and modify their own personal data.

Currently start.gg only supports the authorization code grant flow and refresh token.

I would recommend becoming familiar with the various OAuth concepts such as `resource owner`,
`authorization server`, and `client` before moving on.
There are many resources available on the web for learning these, and <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/oauth-20-beginners-guide" target="_blank">this blog post</a> gives a good overview for beginners.

## How do I use OAuth?

The first step is to create an OAuth application via the <a href="https://start.gg/admin/profile/developer/applications" target="_blank">start.gg developer portal</a>

### Authorization code flow

The authorization code grant flow is a quick 5 step process:

1. Client redirects resource owner to start.gg authorization url.
2. Resource owner signs in with start.gg
3. Resource owner approves token usage and scopes.
4. start.gg sends an **authorization code** to application's `redirect_uri`.
5. Application server sends this code to start.gg's token url in exchange for an **access token**.



Example authorization url:

```
http://start.gg/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=0&scope=user.identity%20user.email&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fexampleurl.com%2Foauth
```

There is a tool in your application's settings that will generate this url for you. The required
query params for this url are:

`response_type`: Must be `code`

`client_id`: The ID of your application, can be found in the application settings page.

`scope`: A list of [scopes](/oauth/scopes) separated by URL encoded space characters (%20)

`redirect_uri`: This is where the resource owner gets redirected to during step 4 above.
The authorization code is included as the query parameter `code`

\
\
Example redirect url:

```
http://exampleurl.com/oauth?code=dsbf6h12sd8mdfwEzF
```

This endpoint is responsible for sending a POST request to start.gg's token url:
`api.start.gg/oauth/access_token`

The following parameters must be sent with a `application/json` Content Type header:

`grant_type`: must be `authorization_code`.

`client_secret`: The secret for application, can be found in the application settings page.

`code`: The code that was sent as a query parameter during the redirect.

`scope`: List of scopes separated by a space.

`client_id`: The same client id from before.

`redirect_uri`: The same redirect uri from before.

\
\
Example access token response:

```
{
	"access_token": "4eeFpL20Adsbf6h12sd8mdfwEzF",
	"token_type": "Bearer",
	"expires_in": 604800,
	"refresh_token": "d8md12s4eeAdsbf6fwEzF0hFpL2"
}
```

This access token allows you to make API calls from your application on behalf of this user,
restricted to the scopes that were approved.

### Refresh token

This access token will expire in `expires_in` seconds, so you can use the `refresh_token` to
obtain a new access token before the user's access expires.

To refresh a token, send a POST request to start.gg's refresh token url:
`api.start.gg/oauth/refresh`

The following parameters must be sent with a `application/json` Content Type header:

`grant_type`: must be `refresh_token`.

`refresh_token`: The refresh token that was given previously.

`scope`: The same scopes as before.

`client_id`: The same client id from before.

`client_secret`: The same client secret from before.

`redirect_uri`: The same redirect uri from before.
