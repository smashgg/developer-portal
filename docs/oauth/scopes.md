## What is a scope?

A scope is what tells a token what resources it has access to. The scopes that are requested by a
third party application are determined by the developer, and the resource owner must approve them at
the time of authentication.

## What scopes do I have access to?

Please keep in mind that we are still actively developing new scopes to be available here.

| Scope | Description |
|---|---|
| user.identity | Allows use of `currentUser` query and all public fields for the user. Any private fields require additional scopes. |
| user.email | Allows use of `email` field in `currentUser` query. `user.identity` scope is also required for this to work. |
| tournament.manager | Allows access to tournament seeding and bracket setup for tournaments the current user has access to. |
| tournament.reporter | Allows access to set reporting for tournaments the current user has access to. |
