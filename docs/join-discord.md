Our Discord server is the best place to discuss our public API, get help from our engineers and community devs,
find collaborators, and promote your projects using the API!

## How to Join our Community on Discord

1. If you do not already have a Discord account, then <a href="https://discordapp.com/register" target="_blank">make one</a>!
2. Go to <a href="https://discord.gg/startgg" target="_blank">discord.gg/startgg</a> to join our server
3. Once you have joined our server, go to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/339548254704369677/804395586672525333/805096084527251516" target="_blank">#roles</a> channel and react on this message (this will give you the 3rd-party-devs role in our server)
4. Now you can read and participate in channels like
