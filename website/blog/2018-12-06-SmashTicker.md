## The Creator

<a href="https://github.com/AQuackenbos" target="_blank">Andrew Quackenbos</a>
developed this Chrome extension
(originally using our old public REST API).
When I saw him <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/a0kt0h/smashticker_for_chrome_updated_for_ultimate_now/" target="_blank">post about it on Reddit</a>,
I messaged him about our new GraphQL API.
Within just a few hours, Andrew had already converted his project to using it!
That was _so awesome_.
